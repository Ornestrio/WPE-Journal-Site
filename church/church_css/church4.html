        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This was a Bible study held by John Paul Casiwan, and Dollen T. Gabutan. I was a participant along with other friends, save for my friend and ate Dollen. This event happened on November 17, at 8:00 PM.</p>
            <p>This was more like a fellowship than a Bible study. It focused more on sharing stories of our lives while singing praises to God. Sr Pastor Rigel was present there, at the request of our organizers. He told us more of his life story and encouraged us to do the same. The Bible study ended with dinner prepared for us. </p>
            <p>The experience did not leave me a world view thought. However, I did feel closer to my friends that day. Most likely, I would also once again team up with them in the future. That day encouraged me to socialize a little bit more. I could see myself opening up to these types of events more.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I am blessed to have met my friends. I learned that if I want to grow closer, I should open up my stories and listen to theirs as well. </p>
