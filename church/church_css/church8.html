        <div class="reflection">
            <p>The Christmas Outreach was held on November 27 that started at 4:00 PM. It was held in the SU church. I was a participant as part of the PEP classes. The PEP classes were told to donate gifts to the visitors in the church.</p>
            <p>I saw quite a lot of people that weren’t wearing IDs so I found out they were visitors in the Silliman Church. Students stood up from the chairs and started distributing gifts to them. I wasn’t part of the distributors so I simply sat and looked at the act. I was with 2 of my friends when this event occurred. The church was singing a choir and scriptures before the giving of gifts.</p>
            <p>When the event happened, I saw quite a lot of people on the other side. I remembered how many people were the needy, and they needed the gifts. It was also December, which is Christmas, and it definitely felt like the month of giving. I could not clearly see because of my eyes but I do know that the people were grateful for the gifts.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I learned that people aren’t as blessed in Christmas. But because we of the spirit of giving, I am sure that their spirits were lifted high. The activity was a success as people loved the gifts.</p>
