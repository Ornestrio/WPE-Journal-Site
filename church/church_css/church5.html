            <p>This is the Galilean Fellowship that was held at 5:30 PM. This was held at the Ausejo Hall Building on the third floor. Most of my classmates attended this fellowship.</p>
            <p>Originally to be at the amphitheatre, it was moved to the AH building due to the rain at that time. On this event, we sang praise songs, had an acting part, and an exchange of prayers written in a piece of paper with our peers. It was a fun activity due to my classmates and also the ones that spoke. The most fun part in this activity was when they told us to recreate the battle between David and Goliath. Their topic was, coincidentally enough, facing your fears. They had a box in which we had to grab out without knowing what was inside. I felt more curiousity than fear however. </p>
            <p>It could not really change my world view since it did feel like a minor event. I can see the benefit of doing a similar activity again, bonding with my own classmates. It was fun to be around people like my classmates.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I further concluded that my classmates werenâ€™t silent people. Recalling the first few events with my classmates, they were certainly quiet. Most people have adapted to social life in Silliman University compared to the first few events where it felt like this batch was quiet.</p>
