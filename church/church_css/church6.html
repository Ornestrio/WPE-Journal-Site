        <div class="reflection">
            <p>The CCS Convocation was held on November 20, starting at 6:30. It was held at the SU church. I was a participant that attended the convocation along with most of my batchmates. Other departments of Silliman also joined in this convocation. </p>
            <p>In this convocation, it was like the devotion we had back in August 19. Although without the emphasis of founder’s week and being new students in Silliman. One of the few things that made me chuckle was some CCS students, wearing the CCS polo shirt took pictures then turned to leave. In which Ma’am Joy saw and told the attendance committee to have a sign out attendance.</p>
            <p>It has not affected my world view as I’ve went to these church events already. However, it was like the calm before the storm. It made me think about the exams that was nearing itself in 2 weeks. I can see the benefits of going to a church event like this when exams are near so I can think about the exams.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I was able to think on my exams. The nearing exams made me pray to the Lord that day that I may pass. After the event, I silently walked home to the terminal that brings me home.</p>
