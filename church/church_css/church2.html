            <p>The Youth Freedom Fellowship was an event that occurred in November 15, 2024. It started at 6:10 PM. Other classmates also joined me but most of them left because it was socially awkward. My role in this was simply a participant, along with two of my friends.</p>
            <p>In this event, it was a fellowship. It was in the middle of Freedom Park, near the big Negros sign. There was already negative expectation of mine there. “Oh boy, these are people I don’t know.”. There were other events happening in the area as well so it wasn’t just this event. There were NORSUnian students training for their ROTC, and a cultural event that used the stage of Freedom Park. I noticed this since I was a lot nervous. One of the two friends, was one that I just met. We had a mutual goal of going together in this fellowship, since I would prefer not to go alone. My other friend tagged along as well.</p>
            <p>The fellowship’s topic, was surprisingly coincidental of what I was feeling at the time. Fear. They talked about different kinds of fear. And as a person who prefers to avoid talking to people first, it strucked home. I simply just need to get over my fear of social anxiety. If I could redo this scenario, I would however prefer not to. Contrary to what I just said earlier.</p>
            <p>Because of this activiy, I learned the types of fear. Not necessarily learn them, but remember that these types of fears do exist and affect a person’s actions. The fellowship gave me insight on what to improve on as a person.</p>
