            <p>This Bible Study was held by Sr Pastor Rigel Lou B. Libo-on. I was simply a participant, along with others that joined this activity. John Paul, Yorlando, Milj Philipp, and ate Dollen. This occurred on November 17, 2024 at 10:00 AM.</p>
            <p>This was a Bible study was like any other Bible study. It opened with praise songs, a prayer, then the scripture reading. The Sr Pastor Rigel was a fun pastor. I was fighting the urge to sleep but thankfully, I was not able to fall asleep, because of the interesting topic we had that day. The pastor shared his life stories with us that was interesting, but also gave me an insight to what life could be.</p>
            <p>Repentance is something that people usually testify whenever they share the gospel, and despite the common similarities, each one when broken down into, cannot be said as “they are similar”. The Sr Pastor shared his own experiences when he wasn’t walking with God. His life experiences could give me an insight on what to do and what not to do. If I could do this event again, I should have asked what he felt when leaving his sinful ways behind.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I’ve thought about the experiences of different people. They share their life stories with us, and end with a lesson in life that tell us not to go where they have been before. The pastor helped me understand that more.</p>
