        <div class="reflection">
            <p>The Founders Week Devotion started from 7:30 AM to to 9:00 AM on August 19. The attendees were the CCS Faculty and students. Other departments also attended in this event. My role in this was helping set up breakfast after the Devotion, and also an attendee of the event.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Logistics Committee, I was a bit nervous at first. This was my first time joining a committee that helps set up events, and the Logistics Committee sent a message in the group chat, to go early for those who are free before 7:30 AM. I was expecting much more things to do, but then found out they had most things planned out already. I only managed to help out carry and deposit ice into the 3rd floor of UCS. One of the people in the Logistics Committee, which I do not remember who, beckoned me and my friend to wait at the lobby for the ice.</p>
            <p>I am usually a quiet person, that whenever I am dropped into a new environment with barely anyone I know, Iâ€™d usually keep to myself and sometimes observe what others are doing. What are they doing? What is their role? What is their name? Are they freshmen like me? They look like they know what they are doing so they must be seniors. These thoughts rang in my head, as I simply did what I was told and waited outside.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I got an insight what my role entails as a member of the Logistics Committee. It was like a trial test of what I can do. In this event, that was held in a church, I could see the faces of people that I would come to know later on.</p>
