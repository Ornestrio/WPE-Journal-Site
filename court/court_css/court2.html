        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was held on October 20, at 2:20 PM at RUSI Ballfield. Initially, I went there as a spectator with 2 of my friends, Miguel and Daniel, and somehow met up with the rest of my friends by sheer coincidence. The event was a frisbee competition. This event was hosted by Blacklist Ultimate.</p>
            <p>This competition was a bit odd. I saw the poster, the date, time, and location and expected it to be a big field sport. Must be soccer I thought but when we arrived, it was a frisbee competition. I wasn’t expecting a frisbee tournament. I am aware most things probably have a tournament but a frisbee tournament was a surprise. On that day, it was also quite rainy so we were only there for an hour, partially because we were also waiting for a friend to arrive. The competition was still on-going despite the weather. I wondered if they would postpone it due to the winds but surprisingly, it still went on. When we decided to finally leave, it started raining harder but I could not check back if they were still playing or not.</p>
            <p>In an event like this, I wouldn’t say I would go out to watch another one but playing in one seems fun. Playing for fun would be a definite yes but a competitive one? Probably not. I can definitely see the advantages of joining such event. You would be testing agility, reflexes, and your speed on this one. It would be preferable to join a tournament like this instead of basketball.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to be closer with my friends. Meeting up was a coincidence, and I called my other friend there for a point in court and because most of us were there. The event was also quite fun to watch back and forth with the frisbees.</p>
