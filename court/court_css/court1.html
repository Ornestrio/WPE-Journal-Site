            <p>This event was held by the CCS Confederates Student Council. Held on August 22, at 2:30 PM. I was a participant, and I went there with a new friend I just made. We were only spectators. The event was about who can code programs within a given time and it was scored based on the efficiency of the code.</p>
            <p>This coding competition was something I initially wanted to join, but I was too shy to ask about the instructions. Luckily, I did not join since it was required to use the C language, a language that I have not learned. The programs to be created that I remember were, palindromes and rock paper scissors. I observed the participants struggled to make these programs. Out of curiosity I tried to create the rock paper scissors one in Python which I managed to do. Watching the competition was interesting since I get to know what might be in store for me in CCS 2. I also befriended someone in this activity. There was however, 3 teams in the competition. It might have been 4-5 but someone left around 10 minutes after they sat down.</p>
            <p>The competition was an interesting one. I have heard of competitive coding before, but it was usually done with a given deadline of months or days. This was my first time seeing it in real time with only a few hours. If I could and if the event would exist next year, I would definitely participate to see how far I have gone.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to gain a friend. I also learned a number of things in this competition. I asked the senior who handled the competition if I could have a copy of the papers he handed out that was printed for the competitors and I was intrigued to definitely try it out next year. </p>
