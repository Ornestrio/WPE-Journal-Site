        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was hosted on November 10, at 5:30, in Pantawan Park. The event was hosted by our city, Dumaguete City. I went there as a spectator and watched from the sidelines. The triathlon involved running, cycling, and swimming.</p>
            <p>I only watched in Boulevard as I would not be able to catch up to the athlethes running, cycling, and swimming (wherever the swimming part took place). I watched as the announcer announced the names that arrived in the finish place and simply listened to music. I walked from the public market to Pantawan Park and noticed of road blocks. It was also quite traffic in some places because of the event. The great thing was that the event took place on a day that was neither too hot nor too cold. The most annoying part was getting to the venue.</p>
            <p>The experience did not affect my world view however it did make me think if I could participate in these events. With my physical attributes, most definitely no, but I used to participate in swimming competitions, and I know how to ride a bike (although I haven’t rode one in years). I guess the only problem would be stamina. Then I remember it’s for athlethes, and I am not an athlete. Maybe in the future I could participate in a small triathlon.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I got more outgoing. I stuck longer than I needed to though. I realized I wouldn’t be going out to these events because of GE-10. I can say that instead of staying at home, I was more and more outgoing. Perhaps I can be more outgoing more if I went out more. It was a bit exciting to feel like I wasn’t going to be stuck inside my own house.</p>
