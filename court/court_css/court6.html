            <p>This event was held in November 25, at the RUSI race track at 7:30. This was very near to my house so it was basically within walking distance. The competition was organized by RUSI. I went there as a spectator by myself.</p>
            <p>I initially didn’t even know about this event, but because I lived nearby, I decided to check it out. I told my friends about it and some of them had went to the event, although I did not come out to meet them. The event was ongoing from 7:30 until the afternoon since at my house, I could still hear some cheering and motor engines. I thought of wearing a mask going there until I realized it was slightly raining, so dust wouldn’t fly into my face. The only part I dislike about the experience was definitely the loud racing sounds and I went there early in the morning. </p>
            <p>The experience did not affect my worldview, since it was just a racing competition. I didn’t even know there was a racing tournament until I heard the voice of the announcer. So whether I like it or not as long as I live nearby, I would always know if there is a racing tournament in the RUSI race track field.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I went outside of my house to check it out. It was simply a racing tournament. I usually prefer to avoid a racing tournament. I searched up the competitors and it seemed like they were a new team that formed. They also looked like teenagers. I was surprised to see teenagers in a racing tournament.</p>
