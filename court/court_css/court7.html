        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This was an event held in the Daro gym, in December 8. It was at 8 AM, in which I was a co-organizer. I brought snacks and some ice packs for the players who were all CCS students, in which some of them were my friends. This event was organized by the FBPC team.</p>
            <p>In the event, I brought some ice cooler and packs of ice. I also used my water bottle as the ice cooler since the ice cooler itself didn’t seem like it was doing it’s job well. I didn’t drink from my water bottle but we used plastic cups to distribute water to the players. When the teams played against eachother, I made sure the water they would drink is cold, and watched them play the games. After it was almost finished, I made sure to clean any wrappers and cups left behind.</p>
            <p>In this event, I would continue my involvement in the organization as a helper. I see myself as a helper to help achieve it’s goals. I would like to continue working with the group to further develop my skills working in an organization</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I learned how to manage an event. Although it was only to make sure the players are well refreshed, I am satisfied with my role. I should start from small roles, to see if I can handle big roles later on. This event helped me develop the feeling of responsibility.</p>
