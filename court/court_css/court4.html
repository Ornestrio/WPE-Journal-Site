        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was hosted on November 14, 6:00 PM. It was hosted on Macias Complex. Organized by Chessa Sagarbarria, with Atty. Luigi Jaro. I was a spectator. It was a basketball tournament with Barangay Piapi VS Barangay Darou. I also saw some fellow CCS students in this event.</p>
            <p>I wasn’t a fan of basketball so I was unsure what to expect. I could not even identify which team was which in the first few minutes, until I zoomed in on the photos later on since I couldn’t see clearly. Piapi was the leading team as far as I can tell. The event would have been more enjoyable if I had a friend with me.</p>
            <p>The experience did not affect my world view whatsoever. It did made me curious if my own barangay could compete in one of these. I would prefer not to go to another basketball tournament as I couldn’t see the appeal in the sport. Most people love basketball but I can’t seem to grow with it.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I got slightly more curious on how points work in Basketball. Not enough that I would do a full research, but just slightly curious enough to see how the system works. I am aware there would another tournament taking place again with another barangay but I would not be interested enough to join.</p>
