            <p>This event was hosted on November 24. I do not know the exact time this event started so I went to the Pantawan Park at 2 PM. This was was hosted by our city. The event was hosted in Pantawan Park. I was a spectator, who also met 1 CCS batchmate. </p>
            <p>I actually do not know what the event was supposed to be until I searched it up. It was basically like volleyball but you use legs. From the name itself, I figured it would most likely involve a ball which was right. I didn’t imagine it would basically just be volleyball but you use your legs instead. This activity, from what I can tell from the sidelines, was severely postponed. Due to the weather at the time, which was raining heavily and a very windy weather. I don’t think I watched a competitive game but more like a “testing” phase. There were participants yes, but it did not feel like a tournament at the time. Due to the weather, I could clearly see the ball being blown off by the wind. It was already 4:00 but it seemed like they were still testing the wind conditions at the time.</p>
            <p>I did not change my world view. The event was simply just a tournament in which I did not know a sport like that existed. It was an obscure sport that reminded me of the traditional game takyan. I wasn’t good with takyan so I doubt I would attempt to play this sport other than for fun.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I learned that a volleyball-like game that uses legs instead of your hands to hit the ball exists. I also managed to explore the activities around Pantawan Park since I didn’t know the exact time of the event. My basis for when it started is 4:00 since it was the time where I started to notice players gathering around the area.</p>
