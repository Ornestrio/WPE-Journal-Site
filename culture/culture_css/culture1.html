        <div class="reflection">
            <p>The Parada Sillimania was held on August 26, at 2:30 PM. My role there was a performer/dancer. The Cheercom was responsible for handling our practices we held for this event. This event was the parade for the celebration of Silliman Founders.</p>
            <p>This was going to be my first time ever in a parade where I was part of the lead performance. I was also a new student to Silliman. This was literally going out of my comfort zone but still, I really enjoyed the parade. To forget my embarassment, I just had to focus on myself and on my batchmates that was with me. It was very enjoyable and very fun watching a senior don a horse mask over himself. The parade itself was less nerve wracking, than the whole dance show at the ball field. I did quite a number of mistakes as we had less time than other dancers, and I was also less skilled. But it was enjoyable at the end.</p>
            <p>This event made me socialize more. Not just the event. Joining the committee that allowed me to perform was practically a leap of my own comfort zone. But I liked it. Given the chance next year, I would definitely perform again and this time do it without mistakes (hopefully).</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I was able to perform a dance routine. It also gives me a reason to go outside more other than staying in my house. The event and the committee was a definite help in increasing my social outlook in life. </p>
