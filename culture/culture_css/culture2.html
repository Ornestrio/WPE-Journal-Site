            <p>The Acquaintance Party was held on September 28, at 6:00 PM. My role there was a performer. Due to nothing to do at the time, I was already at the venue since 4:30 PM. CCS Faculty and students were there in the party.</p>
            <p>I have performed as a dancer before but this was the first time it could be up close. It was also night time and my choice to wear a black mask was a mistake looking back on it again. I could barely see with my glasses as I opted to dance without it. The mask had slits so I could slightly see but without my glasses it was only slightly helping. The lightsâ€™ was a bit too bright despite my mask so I made even more mistakes than the parade. Our dance routine was reused from the parada event, and our positions was somewhat changed.</p>
            <p>This event was fun and I got to socialize even more. I got closer with my friends, and performed once more. Given next year, I might do it again, but from what I can tell, freshmen should have it as their year. I would still attend but only as a participant.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I was a bit embarassed with my mistakes in the dance routine. However, I enjoyed my time there. I took pictures and the theme was very cool. I left when it everyone started dancing since it was getting late. </p>
