            <p>This event was held at the Guy Hall on November 27, at 3:00 PM. This event focused on the women of Negros Oriental and it’s founding. The event was organized by SUSG SPAG. I joined as a spectator, with 3 of my friends, Thomas, Ernst, and Benz.</p>
            <p>The event was about the start of Negros Women For Tomorrow. My 3 friends were there with me. Initially just me, Benz, and Ernst, Thomas was able to catch up. The event talks about how the organization functions. It talked about the organization’s history as well. Initially, I thought the organization is an advocation for pushing Negros women to have higher callings and job positions. It was actually more than that. It did more than just a simply pushing Negros women to be more confident, it helped their finances as well. Particularly for the low income women. </p>
            <p>The organization has affected my world view. An organization, dedicated on helping women realize their worth. It’s also a non-government organization. I would not be interested in joining another session of this cause however. I am simply interested in other things and I cannot dedicate my time for this as well.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I learned the existence of the organization. I also learned how it functions and how it operates. The organization even won presidential recognition in which I am interested.</p>
