            <p>The event was held on Uytengsu Hall. It was held on 10 AM. I joined in and along with my fellow CCS freshmen. The event was about introducing the guidance counselor, Jesa Kitane. It also had a few games to break the ice between the freshmen.</p>
            <p>The guidance and counseling event was a way to know what the guidance counselor does. There were some games that basically encouraged everyone to meet other people. The first game was about evolution. Sort of like 2048 but more simplified. This way, it is ensured you would meet at least 5 people before finally winning. The odds of winning immediately were extremely low, and I was one of the unlucky few who did not manage to “evolve”, therefore meeting a lot more people than anyone else. I couldn’t remember their names nor stayed friends with one of them but it was a fun activity nonetheless. The 2nd activity was forming groups and then make a line with the group. The head of the line must chase the tail of the other group and vice versa. I was quite skinny and I didn’t really like the feeling since I had to hold on tight, even though I let go a few times. Overall, it was still a fun activity and a nice icebreaker.</p>
            <p>The experience has affected my worldview. These were essentially strangers but because of a game, it didn’t feel like it was embarassing. Everyone was practically equal. It made me think that with a great icebreaker, you would be able to get to know people and be comfortable around them. I also learned of the guidance counselor. I do hope my mental state does not decline to have a meeting chance. I plan to be mentally strong.</p>
            <p>Because of the activity, I managed to make a few friends. It was a fun event that teaches the importance of going to the guidance counselor if you are in need of mental help. The event also helped with breaking the ice for the freshmen to know eachother.</p>
