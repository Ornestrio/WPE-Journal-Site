        <p>This event was held in August 19, at 2:30 PM. The event was organized by the CCS Student Council. The speakers were the people at Miller Solutions. This was held in the Uytengsu Hall 3rd floor building.</p>
        <p>The event was held during founders. They discussed about Web Development in which I was able to take some notes. I was still a new student and so I was still in that state of “Oh how interesting!” stage. The discussion was inline with my course, so I had learn a lot of new terms I haven’t heard before. Web Development isn’t something I would pursue with interest but it is still a skill I should at least learn on how it works and the basics since I will inevitable tackle on it later on in life.</p>
        <p>The experience didn’t affect my world view. It was a simple discussion about Web Development. I can apply this learning as hardcoding my journal project as a website. A test of what I can do and a I can experience what it is like to make such a website. I can definitely see the benefits of participating another event like this as it can make me learn.</p>
        <p>Because of this activity, I was able to learn a few things about Web Development. I would able to use this knowledge in creating websites. I could most definitely use this in my future endeavors. Projects that the department will ask and my own self improvement projects can make use of this knowledge. </p>
