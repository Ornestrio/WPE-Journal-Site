            <p>This event was held at the Uytengsu Hall. It was held on August 21, at 8:30 AM. I was joined by fellow CCS students and some of my classmates who wished to participate. The event was simply a trivia questionnaire about Silliman and CCS as a whole.</p>
            <p>In the whole event, I didn’t really know what to expect. Since it had “royale” in it, I thought it was going to be played like elimination but it wasn’t. The event was a learning experience for me as a new student of Silliman University. The CCS Student Council gave us questions regarding CCS. I could not answer some of these obviously, but I only managed to answer some due to sheer luck and the process of elimination. There were also some questions about Silliman University itself. I could not answer most of it. The most enjoyable part is that they would reveal the answer after the question, so I would learn a few more facts about CCS and Silliman.</p>
            <p>This experience affected me somewhat. I realized I barely knew anything about CCS or Silliman University. As a CCS student, I should at least know the answers to these by next year. If by next year, the event would be held again, I would join just to see if I could answer the questions I should probably know the answer to.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to learn a few more things about CCS and Silliman University. It was a simple trivia quiz activity to see if students learned of their own department and university. I would most likely join the next year just to see if I would fare better than this year’s attempt.</p>
