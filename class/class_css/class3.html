            <p>The Igniting Creativity event was an event that was held in August 20, at 2:00 PM. I joined as a spectator and some of my new friends joined me as well. The event was about creating sentences and see which is popular via a voting system. </p>
            <p>The event was held during founders. This event was sort of competitive in nature, because you had to construct sentences. The highest voted sentence would win if it is voted due to popularity. I had taken a few times to try it out myself. Some sentences that popped up were a bit vulgar but nonetheless, it felt fun. The goal was simply to make statements that could be popular, which was simple enough to understand. In the other corner of the room, I did see someone playing some card games.</p>
            <p>The experience didn’t really affect my world view. It was simply a game to try and create sentences that could gain popularity. If this event would be hosted again, I would definitely try it again. The benefits I could have by doing this is seeing how other CCS students think.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to learn what other’s humor are like. They have constructed weird sentences but it was dark humor. It was strangely welcoming in it’s own way. I think I can definitely get along with my new batchmates.</p>
