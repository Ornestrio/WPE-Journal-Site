            <p>8. Sinergy Labs
                This event was held at  Dr. Mariano and Lina Lao Activity Center on December 4. It previously held 2 different workshop events on the two other Wednesdays before that date. I was only a spectator on the event, and I was with my friends: Benz, Thomas, and Ernst. 
                </p>
            <p>The workshop was very interesting. Out of all classroom events, this was the most interesting I had joined. 3D printing needs to have 3D modeling. I would suck at designing things and itâ€™s not just about the design. It also has to be an efficient one. I learned quite a few things in this workshop event. The material to use, the tips on how to use a 3D printer, and how to utilize it. I saw other students from another college attending this workshop. It was an interesting experience in which I also had an opportunity to hold one of the models it had created. </p>
            <p>This activity affected my world view. 3D modeling is an interesting skill to learn. Maybe in the future, I might take up on 3D modeling so that I can create my own designs using micro chips. It would be an advantageous skill to have. </p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I learned the basics of 3D modeling. Not necessarily how to start the machine up or actually model an object, but some of the fundamentals in 3D modeling. Just like you need to make sure to clean the machine first, make sure the model is efficiently designed, and some tips on how to make sure it runs smoothly.</p>
