        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was held in August 22, at 9 AM. This was organized by the CCS Student Council and the speakers were from the Miller Solutions company. I joined as a participant, along with fellow CCS batchmates.</p>
            <p>The event was held by Miller Solutions. I was able to learn what UI/UX design means. The speakers were able to give a nice discussion about those terms. The speakers themselves were Silliman graduates, who also discussed about their work lives. It was a simple discussion, sharing knowledge about user design and how the user can easily navigate. </p>
            <p>I was able to learn about UX design primarily. Of course, UI design is something I already knew. Making things aesthetically pleasing to the eye, can attract people. But I didn’t know that UX was a different thing. I thought that the concept of UX was already part of UI design. They are partnered together but not the same. </p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I was able to learn how to differentiate UX and UI designing. Of course, this discussion isn’t limited only to my future lessons, but also to my personal endeavors. I could be making website designs or applications and this discussion can help me start. </p>
