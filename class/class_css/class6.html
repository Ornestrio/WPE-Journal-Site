            <p>The campus wide orientation was held in September 11, at 1:50 AM in the Luce Auditiorium. This was a required event, and even if it wasnâ€™t, everyone needs to go. I was a participant and alongside with the other freshmen of other departments. </p>
            <p>This event was a bit questionable for me. Why September 11? It was already a month and a half in Silliman so the event was a bit late in terms of guiding us on Silliman life would be in store for us. Nevertheless, I still managed to gain some insights in the event. Some inside jokes here and there but most importantly I learned some rules of Silliman University. </p>
            <p>This experience was a first for me. A campus wide orientation for freshmen.  I needed this activity since I was a new student of Silliman University. I needed the extra information to at least get to know my campus better. </p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to learn more about Silliman University. The things Silliman have and their life inside the campus. I managed to stay awake since there were some jokes that felt funny considering one of them involved tripping on a walkway.</p>
