        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was held on October 27 on 5:30 AM (or much earlier). It was held at the Pantawan Park. A marathon run that is used to gofund help the movement on ending polio. I joined as a spectator.</p>
            <p>The day the event was hosted that day was rainy. I wondered how the runners faired on the rainy day. It was an experience that was really cold since it was quite raining and the winds were slightly strong. The event started as a success even if it was raining. The run to end polio act was a generous organized event. I did wonder if some of them got sick due to the rain, it wouldn’t be a surprise but I hope no one did.</p>
            <p>The experience affected my world view. The act to make an event and use the profits to help fund the end to polio was a most generous act. I have heard of polio and the iron lunged people. It sounds so scary and devastating to contracting that disease. It would practically ruin your entire life. So these people and the participants are generous people for still caring to the people who are affected by this disease.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I researched how these events worked. I wanted to know more about how an event would function and how their profits would turn to helping the end polio movement. I also wondered how much of them weren’t athletes but still joined to help end polio.</p>
