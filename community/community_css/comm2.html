        <div class="reflection">
            <p>This event was held on September 29, at 5:50 AM. Organized by the CCS Student Council, this event aimed to clean the Silliman Beach. I was joined by my friends and some batchmates from CCS. I joined as a participant.</p>
            <p>This was my first time ever going to an orphanage. I didn’t really know what to do since I didn’t know what to do with children. It was an enjoyable experience nonetheless. I didn’t have a gift to give to them on hand since I was registered quite late, but I did manage to give them a paper of just Japanese characters. I doubt they’d ever read it. I also tried to just tried teaching them Japanese as I don’t have any idea on how to handle children. I am unsure if they got lucky or they actually learned but one of them had a streak of 5 in identifying letters.</p>
            <p>The experience affected my world view. As orphaned children don’t have parents, they only have their caretakers as their parental figures. I also wonder how orphaned children would be able to go to school. Who would provide for them? It was something I just realized at the time of writing this. </p>
            <p>Because of this activity, we managed to donate toys and food to orphaned children. I tried teaching them Japanese since I don’t know what to do with them. I also felt pity for the children who don’t have a parental figure other than their caretakers.</p>
