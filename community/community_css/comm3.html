            <p>This event was held on October 19, at 2:30 PM. The event was held at John Paul Casiwan’s house. He was also one of the organizers along with Ate Dollen. I joined as a working committee member. This event held as a Halloween Party, that we gifted gifts and food to the neighboring children.</p>
            <p>The event was held at my friend’s house. He also was the one who drove me to his house since I lived in Lower Cantil-e and he lived in Richwood Homes, which was quite close to my home. The event played games and we gave them food. I also still wouldn’t know how to handle children so I stood back only helping distributing food and watched. The children had costumes whereas we wore black clothings (save for me). There were also a lot of dogs in the area that looked quite dangerous though. For a little while I explored JP’s area and then later find out Ate Dollen lived in Richwoods as well.</p>
            <p>The experience hasn’t affected my world view. It was a Halloween Party primarily to give food to the neighboring kids. Aside from the wandering stray dogs, I was quite scared that one of the kids would smack one and end up getting bit. Thankfully, no kid did that. I am not sure if I would want to join another activity such as this, mainly because of the children.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, we managed to provide an enjoyable experience to the neighboring children. We gave them food and some gifts. Even played some games for them. The experience was an enjoyable one.</p>
