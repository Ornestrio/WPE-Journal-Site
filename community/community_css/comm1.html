            <p>This event was held on September 29, at 5:50 AM. Organized by the CCS Student Council, this event aimed to clean the Silliman Beach. I was joined by my friends and some batchmates from CCS. I joined as a participant.</p>
            <p>The cleanup drive was a success. Aside from waking up early (which was a good thing or else it'd be hot), it was still an enjoyable experience. The beach was a mess, so we cleaned it up. We did find quite a number of trash on the beach. Plastic bottles, wrappers, and glass bottles as well. Plastic was more prevalent than the oher materials. The Silliman Beach cleanup drive was one of the first experiences I had in cleaning locations that were filled with trash.</p>
            <p>When I first came to Silliman Beach, it was about when I was in elementary. My family used to drive there just to have peaceful lunch. I don’t ever recall that the beach smelled badly. It affected my world view on the state of our beaches. I don’t remember that Silliman Beach smelled badly in the past at all. Or is it simply because I had forgotten? It made me realize how much pollution is damaging the experience of going to the beach.</p>
            <p>Because of this activity, I managed to help clean up the state of Silliman Beach. I also realized how much dirty and smelly it is in there. I would like to thank our community helpers that clean up locations that have the same state or even worse, than Silliman Beach.</p>
